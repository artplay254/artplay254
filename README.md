# Hi — I'm **Artem Semenihin** 👋  
**Disciplined · Curious · Introverted · Active · Tech-driven**

```ts
// about.me (short, typed)
const Artem = {
  name: "Artem Semenihin",
  born: "Dec 7, 2010",
  location: "Lipetsk, Russia",
  age: 15,
  mindset: ["learn fast", "choose hard paths", "value deep friendships"],
  stacks: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Linux", "Git"],
  daily: ["Arch Linux", "KDE Plasma", "VS Code", "Firefox"],
  hobbies: ["calisthenics", "parkour", "math", "physics", "building things"]
};
export default Artem;
```

> One sentence: I'm a disciplined, curious, introverted, active, tech-driven young creator who chooses hard paths, avoids fake people, values deep connections, and is building myself into a strong, capable person — intellectually, physically, and morally.

<details>
<summary><strong>About me — longer (click to expand)</strong></summary>I'm quiet by nature and love deep conversations and honest friendships. I can be goofy and I also dig deep theoretical rabbit holes — especially anything that touches math, physics, and wild universe theories.
I care about health (I drink lots of water, eat clean), I love active life (workouts, parkour, flips, street tricks), and I enjoy tinkering with tech — from building PCs to configuring Arch Linux. I started learning English through full immersion at 13 and now operate (and think) in English a lot — it's how I learn, build, and connect with the world.

I value quality, durability, and trusted brands — whether it's software, gear, or ideas. I want to move to Europe (Norway is my main inspiration right now) for the nature, clean air, stability, and quiet culture. My plan is to finish school, study, build skills and portfolio, work remotely, travel Europe, and decide where to settle by ~2032–2035.

WakaTime — Nord-style coding card (visual)

> Note: percentages below are illustrative placeholders — replace with real WakaTime language stats or link generated badges if you want live data.



<div align="center">

Language	Time (approx)

</div><details>
<summary><strong>Make this live</strong></summary>If you connect WakaTime public language badges or the "languages" share link, replace the table above with actual SVGs or a small generated card.

I matched colors to a Nord-like palette to keep the theme cohesive (cool blues, soft auroras).

Languages & Tools

<details>
<summary><strong>What I use / learning now</strong></summary>





Learning sources: FreeCodeCamp, YouTube tutorials, docs, StackOverflow


</details><details>
<summary><strong>My daily environment</strong></summary>









GitHub, WakaTime, terminal, dotfiles, and a good config.


</details><details>
<summary><strong>What's next (roadmap)</strong></summary>I'm following the Full Stack Developer roadmap to shape the "what next" list — backend basics, databases, deployment, and deeper JavaScript/TypeScript. See my next steps below. 

Node.js basics → APIs → DB (Postgres, SQLite)

Learn TypeScript → build typed apps

Learn basics of Linux server ops & deploy small apps

Explore React / Svelte — pick one for portfolio

Start freelancing / remote projects

Europe Quest — my path (levels)

I call this my Europe Quest — the roadmap from school in Lipetsk → living calmly and working remotely in Europe (goal: Norway). Final target: travel, decide, move (2032–2035).

<details>
<summary><strong>Quest Levels</strong></summary>1. Level 1 — Finish school strong (9–11 grades).


2. Level 2 — University / College (3–5 years).


3. Level 3 — Build coding fundamentals (HTML/CSS/JS → advanced).


4. Level 4 — Portfolio & freelancing (10 projects, OSS contributions).


5. Level 5 — Remote job in Europe / internships.


6. Level 6 — Travel across Europe (test countries, gather impressions).


7. Level 7 — Decide & move (choose country → relocate → settle).



Progress: [▮▮▯▯▯▯▯] — early stage, starting the climb.
Final ETA: ~2032–2035 (based on school timeline and growth).

Current Goals (short checklist)

[ ] Get FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification

[ ] Build 10 portfolio projects

[ ] Contribute to open source

[ ] Master fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS, data structures)

[ ] Launch Discord community → 100+ members

[ ] Reach 100 hours of coding (WakaTime)

Featured projects (work in progress)

> Short list — all actively being built and improved.



Portfolio v1 — personal site with dark-nord theme, responsive projects gallery (in progress)

Parkour-Log — small app to track runs & tricks (idea → prototype)

Linux Dotfiles — curated Arch + KDE setup (work in progress)

Mini JS Utilities — useful micro-libraries for learning (in progress)


(links will appear here as I publish them)

How I learn

Structured free resources: freeCodeCamp (curriculum), official docs, and roadmap.sh.

Deep dives: YouTube tutorials (Stan Browney, Magnus Midtbø, Sergio Nee), hands-on building, and reading other people's code.

Daily habit: small builds, 5am cold shower mornings sometimes, workouts, and consistent practice.



---

Values & style

I value truth, respect, and honest feedback.

I don't follow trends for the sake of trends — I value quality and durability.

I keep a small circle of real friends; we push each other to be better.

Resources & inspiration

Badge library & examples: md-badges (useful collection to style READMEs). 

Capsule-style header/banners (used above): capsule-render — fast dynamic banners for GitHub READMEs. 

Typing / animated SVGs for READMEs: readme-typing-svg / TypingSVG generators. 

Roadmaps & learning path: roadmap.sh (Full Stack Developer) — my reference for next steps. 

Color theme & palette inspiration: Nord theme — used for color choices and vibe. 



---

<details>
<summary><strong>Notes for maintainers (me)</strong></summary>Keep badges lightweight (use SVG badges and hosted svgs) so the README loads fast on all devices.

Replace placeholder WakaTime language badges with live WakaTime language-share badges when ready.

Keep the capsule header text short to avoid wrapping on mobile.

Keep design minimal: avoid heavy gifs or too many large images.
