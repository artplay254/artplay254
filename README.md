## 🎯 **About Me**

I'm **Artem** — a 15-year-old developer, athlete, and deep thinker from Russia, working toward a life in Europe. I don't follow trends; I build myself intentionally. I value **truth over comfort**, **depth over surface**, and **action over words**.

I'm the friend who tells you the truth even when it's uncomfortable. I don't nod blindly to people. I believe in filters, standards, and boundaries — people who drag you down don't belong in your life.

I'm building myself **intellectually** (coding, math, physics), **physically** (calisthenics, parkour, cold showers), and **morally** (honesty, discipline, kindness). I started my journey on **January 1, 2026**, and I'm documenting every step.

**Fun fact:** I daily drive **Arch Linux with KDE Plasma** for over a year. Why? Power, simplicity, freedom. No bloat. No telemetry. Just pure control.

<summary>🌌 <b>The Experimenting Era (2022-2026)</b></summary>

Since I was 12, I've tried everything I could get my hands on. I believe in **experience over theory** and **action over hesitation**.

**What I've explored:**

- 🎨 **Creative:** Blender, photo editing, video editing, audio editing
- 💻 **Tech:** Coding, Arduino, PC building, Linux
- 🏃 **Physical:** Parkour, calisthenics, martial arts, trampoline tricks, climbing
- ⚽ **Sports:** Volleyball, soccer, basketball
- 🛹 **Extreme:** Skate/scooter/BMX tricks
- 🧊 **Discipline:** Cold showers, 5 AM wake-ups, daily workouts
- 💼 **Business:** Creating business plans, studying company histories
- 🎮 **Creative Building:** Minecraft architecture

**Philosophy:** If I haven't tried it, I don't have an opinion. If I've tried it, I know whether it's for me.

<summary>💪 <b>Why I Choose Hard Paths</b></summary>

I naturally don't like when something is easy. When someone gets a harder task than me, I try to swap with them.

**Why?** Because:

- Easy things don't teach you anything
- Comfort kills growth
- The harder the challenge, the stronger you become
- I want to be capable, not comfortable

**Inspired by:**

- **Dragon Ball** — Get up, no matter how many times you fall
- **Stan Browney, Magnus Midtbø, Sergio Nee** — Masters of discipline & progression
- **Bryan Johnson** — Don't die. Optimize everything.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧘 <b>Health & Lifestyle</b></summary>

I don't believe in "motivation." I believe in **systems** and **discipline**.

**My daily habits:**

- 💧 Drink almost only water (rare exceptions with friends)
- 🥗 Eat clean and healthy (not discipline, just preference)
- 🏋️ Daily workouts (calisthenics, parkour, sports)
- 🧊 Cold showers
- 🌅 5 AM wake-ups
- 🚭 **Zero bad habits** — No smoking, no drinking, no drugs

**Why?** Because I want to be **strong, sharp, and capable** — physically and mentally. I want to live long, feel good, and have energy to create.

I condemn smoking, drinking, and other destructive behaviors. Your body is your only true home — treat it like one.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌍 <b>Why Europe? Why Norway?</b></summary>

**What I'm looking for:**

- 🏔️ Beautiful nature, crisp air, cold lakes
- 🧘 Quiet culture, deep conversations
- 💼 Work-life balance, world-class healthcare
- 🛡️ Economic & geopolitical stability
- 🌍 Freedom to travel across European countries
- 🎿 Hiking, climbing, swimming in peace

**Why Norway specifically (for now)?**

- Nature that feels alive
- Clean air & water
- Safety and stability
- Quiet, introverted-friendly culture
- High quality of life

But I'll travel first. Experience different countries. Then decide.
