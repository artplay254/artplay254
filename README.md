<details>
<summary><b>🧠 What Drives Me</b></summary>

<br>

I'm not your average 15-year-old. While most people my age are scrolling TikTok and wasting their potential, I'm:

- **Waking up at 5 AM** for cold showers and workouts
- **Running Arch Linux** because I value freedom, power, and control
- **Choosing hard paths** because easy ones don't build character
- **Learning English through immersion** (B2 level, thinking in English)
- **Staying disciplined** with clean eating, no bad habits, active lifestyle
- **Building real friendships** that last over 10 years

I experimented with everything since age 12: Blender, video editing, Arduino, parkour, calisthenics, martial arts, business planning, PC building, and more. Now I'm focused on **coding** — my path to freedom and Europe.

I don't follow trends. I build myself into something **exceptional**.

**Inspirations:** Dragon Ball (keep going no matter what), Stan Browney, Magnus Midtbø, Sergio Nee

<summary><b>🤝 The Brotherhood</b></summary>

<br>

Shoutout to my bro **Vlad** ([@vlp0werr](https://github.com/vlp0werr)) — we've been together since kindergarten, over 10 years of true friendship. We share the same goal: **Europe**. We're building ourselves together, pushing each other to be better every single day.

Real friendships are rare. This is one of them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💪 Beyond Coding</b></summary>

<br>

I believe in balance. While I'm building my coding skills, I'm also:

- **Staying physically strong:** Calisthenics, parkour, workouts, sports (volleyball, soccer, basketball)
- **Staying mentally sharp:** Mathematics, physics, deep conversations about the universe
- **Staying disciplined:** Clean eating, water-only drinking, no bad habits
- **Challenging myself:** Taking harder paths, swapping easy tasks for difficult ones

**Health = Wealth.** A strong body supports a strong mind.

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 My Philosophy</b></summary>

<br>

```javascript
const myPhilosophy = {
  truth: "I tell it like it is, even if it's uncomfortable",
  standards: "Filters, boundaries, and high standards keep me surrounded by quality people",
  discipline: "Discipline > Motivation. Always.",
  growth: "Choose the hard path. It makes you stronger.",
  authenticity: "No fake people, no fake friendships, no fake life"
};

// I respect everyone, but I don't tolerate mediocrity in my circle
```
