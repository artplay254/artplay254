**14-year-old developer** | Lipetsk, Russia → Norway  
Building things that matter. Learning every day. Choosing the harder path.

## About Me

I'm a quiet introvert with loud ambition. My goal is simple: become a full-stack developer and move to Norway.

I value deep conversations, real friendships, honesty, discipline, and strength — mental and physical. I think deeply about life, the universe, and how to improve every single day.

**Core interests:** Mathematics, Physics, IT, Linux, programming, gadgets, AI, and technology.

**Daily driver:** Arch Linux + KDE Plasma — clean, powerful, open-source, minimalistic. Built for real work.

## What I Do

Since I was 12, I've been in my experimenting era:

- Blender, video editing, coding
- Arduino projects, hardware tinkering
- Parkour, calisthenics, martial arts, flips
- Minecraft building, Linux customization
- Business ideas, sports, challenges

I choose the harder path on purpose. Easy things don't interest me.

## Lifestyle

Active. Healthy. Challenging.

**Physical:** Workouts, calisthenics, parkour, flips, skate/scooter/BMX tricks, volleyball, soccer, basketball, climbing.

**Habits:** Cold showers, early mornings, clean eating, almost only water. No harmful habits — not from discipline, but because it's who I am.

## Values

- **Honesty** — I speak directly. If something's wrong, I say it.
- **Quality** — I respect durability, craftsmanship, and trusted brands.
- **Real people** — I keep a few close friends I've known for 10+ years. Proven through time, loyalty, and honesty.
- **Growth** — Always improving. Always moving. Always choosing the better road.

I don't respect fake personalities, TikTok addictions, laziness, or weakness.

## Languages

- **Russian:** Native
- **English:** B2 (self-taught through full immersion by age 14 — I think and dream in it now)

---

## Why Norway?

Nature. Mountains. Cold water. Clean air. Calm culture. Stability. Peace.

It's where I see myself thriving.

## Fun Facts

- I love Dragon Ball for its message about growth and resilience.
- I love The Flash for its discipline and heroism.
- I love clean design, minimalism, and clarity in everything I do.

**Always respectful. Always kind. Always honest. Always myself.**
