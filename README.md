# Artem Semenihin

**9th grader from Russia | Just started my coding journey**

I'm learning web development from scratch. Currently going through freeCodeCamp and building my foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No portfolio projects yet - I'm focusing on understanding the fundamentals properly before rushing into building things.

I'm taking the long route - learning properly rather than quickly. Right now I'm working through:
- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS fundamentals and responsive design
- JavaScript basics and DOM manipulation

I learn best by understanding *why* something works, not just memorizing syntax. Once I have solid fundamentals, I'll start building projects.

![KDE Plasma](https://img.shields.io/badge/KDE_Plasma-1D99F3?style=for-the-badge&logo=kde&logoColor=white)

Daily driving Arch Linux with KDE Plasma for over a year. I value control, transparency, and FOSS philosophy. Everything is configured the way I need it - no bloat, no telemetry, just tools that work.

<summary><b>🎯 Beyond Code</b></summary>

<br>

I'm not just about programming. I value:
- **Self-development** - Always challenging myself and trying new things
- **Active lifestyle** - Calisthenics, parkour, sports, outdoor adventures
- **Deep thinking** - Math, physics, theories about the universe
- **Quality over quantity** - In friendships, in tools, in everything

I'm learning English (currently B2) through full immersion. I approach everything with the same philosophy: understand it deeply, do it properly, no shortcuts.

**Future goal:** Move to Norway for the nature, clean air, hiking, and quiet culture.

I'm just starting out, so I don't have much to show yet. But if you want to follow my journey from zero to (hopefully) competent developer, feel free to check back later.

I'm always open to honest feedback and real conversations.

**Note:** This profile will actually have content once I finish learning the basics and start building real projects. For now, it's just documentation of where I'm starting from.
