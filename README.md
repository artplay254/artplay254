## About Me (in TypeScript style)
```ts
const Artem = {
  name: "Artem Semenihin",
  born: "2010-12-07",
  location: "Lipetsk, Lipetsk Oblast, Russia",
  vibe: ["energetic", "disciplined", "minimalist", "tech-aesthetic"],
  aspiration: "Become a Fullstack Developer and move to Norway (2030-2032)",
  languages: ["Russian (native)", "English (B2)", "Norwegian (learning)"],
  tools: ["Arch Linux", "VS Code", "git", "github", "Blender", "Arduino"],
  hobbies: ["parkour","calisthenics","martial arts","volleyball","soccer","basketball","climbing","PC building","photo/video/audio editing","Minecraft builds"],
  learningStyle: ["freeCodeCamp", "YouTube", "docs", "StackOverflow", "reading"],
};
export default Artem;
```

I prefer deep conversations and real friendships over surface noise. I'm quiet by nature but curious and experimental — I try everything once, and keep what works. Right now I'm starting my dev journey (HTML/CSS/JS and web basics) with the long-term goal to become a well-rounded Fullstack developer and move to Norway by 2030–2032. I value discipline, growth, and a minimalist, tech-forward aesthetic.

## Current Goals / Journey
My path is a mix of structured learning and hands-on experiments. I follow the Fullstack roadmap and adapt it to a student schedule.

- Short-term (0–6 months)
  - Finish web basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals
  - Build small projects: personal site, simple game, mini-portfolio
  - Daily habit: 30–60 mins coding + WakaTime tracker

- Mid-term (6–36 months)
  - Learn Node.js, databases (Postgres / MongoDB), REST & GraphQL
  - Start backend projects and deploy simple fullstack apps
  - Learn React + state management, testing basics
  - Participate in small team projects / collab with my bro (github.com/vlp0werr)

- Long-term (3–7 years)
  - Deepen systems design, scalability basics, and advanced front-end
  - Apply to universities / colleges aligned with CS & software engineering
  - Move to Norway around 2030–2032 — language + cultural prep included

Roadmap reference: https://roadmap.sh/full-stack

Norway Quest: Level 1/10
[Progress] █▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ (starting steps: basics, consistency, Norwegian learning)

---

## How I Learn
- Active practice: build small things, then iterate
- Track time: WakaTime + weekly reflection
- Consume: freeCodeCamp, YouTube playlists, documentation
- Community: reading StackOverflow, following focused creators, asking thoughtful questions
- Mindset: disciplined schedule, cold showers & morning routine to stay sharp

---

## Projects & Experiments
- Minecraft builds — creative problem-solving & architecture
- Blender experiments — modeling + renders for portfolio pieces
- Arduino prototypes — small I/O projects to connect hardware and software
- Media editing — photo/video/audio edits for learning tools and storytelling
- PC builds, Linux tinkering — systems-level understanding & optimization

I love making small projects that teach a concept end-to-end — I learn fast when I ship something.

## GitHub Stats

  <img alt="Artem's GitHub stats" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=artplay254&show_icons=true&theme=nightowl&count_private=true" />
  <img alt="Top Languages" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=artplay254&layout=compact&theme=nightowl" />
</p>

(Theme follows a cool, minimal Nord-like palette — fast to load and readable on mobile.)

## WakaTime
- Live coding time badge:

  </a>

I log practice time to keep momentum. Small daily steps win.

## A Note About My Bro
Shoutout to my friend and partner-in-crime since kindergarten: https://github.com/vlp0werr — we share the same goal and push each other forward. Teamwork matters.

---

## Values & Non-Negotiables
I avoid platforms and behaviors that promote addiction or fake interactions:
- Not into TikTok and social media addiction
- I value real friendships and deep conversations
- I avoid lust for instant validation; I focus on long-term compounding growth

---

## Minimal, Fast, Accessible
This README is intentionally light on heavy assets. Images and badges are optimized for fast load on mobile and desktop, and the layout maintains readability in narrow viewports. Fonts and colors follow a Nord-inspired minimalist aesthetic.

---

If you landed here and share similar values — say hi. I respond better to thoughtful messages than to noise. Let's build, experiment, and grow.

— Artem Semenihin (artplay254)
